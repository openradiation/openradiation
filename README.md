# OpenRadiation
This project aims to develop a database to store environmental radioactivity measurements
It's shared in 3 parts : 
* backend : the postgresql backend database
* submit_api : a JSON Rest-like API developed in node.js to submit data to the database
* request_api : a JSON Rest-like API developed in node.js to request the database

Structure of the API : coming soon
